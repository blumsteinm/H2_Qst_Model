# H2_Qst_Model
Code associated with: A new perspective on ecological prediction reveals limits to climate adaptation in a temperate tree species

The code contained in this repository are the post-processing steps for the TNC root and stem data. First, data are corrected for spatial autocorrelation, then run through a bayesian, hierarchical model using the included STAN code, and finally model outputs are used to calculate H2 and Qst.
